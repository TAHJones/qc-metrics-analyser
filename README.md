## Introduction

[QC Metrics Analyser](https://qc-metrics-analyser.herokuapp.com/) is a website that can be used by **Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)** users using [Illuminas](https://www.illumina.com/index-d.html) sequencing chemistries and instruments. The site has been primarily designed for employees of the [Royal Marsden Hospital](https://www.royalmarsden.nhs.uk/) working within the [Molecular Diagnostics department](https://www.royalmarsden.nhs.uk/our-consultants-units-and-wards/clinical-departments/cancer-diagnostics). The department uses [Illumina's sequencing technologies](https://emea.illumina.com/science/technology/next-generation-sequencing/sequencing-technology.html?langsel=/gb/) to detect acquired genetic mutations in patients tumour samples. Patients found to have clinically actionable mutations can then be assigned to an appropriate clinical trial for treatment.

Each NGS sequencing run generates a set of **Sequencing Metrics** which can be used to assess the quality of the sequencing data produced. These sequencing metrics are useful for QC purposes. Firstly to ensure the quality of individual runs remain high and secondly to monitor the performance of the sequencing instruments over time.

The website records and displays four types of QC metric data:

1. **Yield** - Shows the expected number of nucleotide bases sequenced for the run. Typically this is measured in gigabases.

2. **Cluster Density** - Shows the number of clusters detected for the sequencing run.

3. **Clusters Passing Filter** - Shows the percentage of clusters passing the signal purity filter.

4. **Q30 Score**  - Shows the percentage of bases that have a Q-score above or equal to 30; Q30 is a probability of incorrect base calling of 1 in 1000. A quality score, or Q-score, is a prediction of the probability of an incorrect base call. A higher Q-score implies that a base call is higher quality and more likely to be correct.

In addition the website records the following related run information:

1. **Sequencing Chemistry** - The type of chemistry used can be Mid150, Mid300 or High300. This effects the amount of sequencing that can be performed and therefore the expected yield.

2. **Sequencing Experiment** - The type of experiment performed can be Capture, Exome or Genome. This determines the amount of sequencing required and effects the type of chemistry used and therefore the expected yield.

## UX

This site is designed to be used by **laboratory technicians** and **clinical scientists** working within the [Molecular Diagnostics department](https://www.royalmarsden.nhs.uk/our-consultants-units-and-wards/clinical-departments/cancer-diagnostics). Laboratory technicians who set up the sequencing experiments will have standard user accounts and will be able to enter new run data and review previous run data for their own runs. Clinical scientists who analyse the sequencing data will have user accounts with admin privileges so will be able to review runs for multiple users and have a general overview of sequencing run performance.

There are three type of user with three different levels of access to the QC Metrics Analyser website:

- **Unregistered Users** - Users of the site that don't have a user account, who can view run information on the homepage but cannot select, edit, add or delete run qc data.

- **Registered Users** - Users of the site that have created a user account page, who can view, filter, edit and delete their own run data.

- **Registered Users with Admin Privileges** - Users of the site with a user account with admin privileges, who are able to view, filter, edit or delete run qc data for other users. They are also able to view, edit or delete user accounts.


### User Requirements

The user requirements for QC Metrics Analyser are as follows:

- The site is easy and intuitive to use.

- The site provides basic information about NGS qc data for new users.

- The site has different levels of access/security depending on the users status which will be dependent on their training and job role.

- Unregistered users are able to view basic run information but not edit or delete it. They must be able to create a user account using the sign-in in page.

- Registered users must be able to use a unique user name to log into their user account. Once successfully logged in, the user must be able to view, filter, edit and delete their own run information.

- Registered users with admin privileges must be able to use a unique user name to log into their user account. Once logged in as a user they must be able to verify their admin status by using a unique email address. Once successfully logged in with admin privileges they must be able to view, filter, edit or delete run information for individual users. They must also be able to view, edit or delete individual user accounts.

3. Deleting Selected Run - Once an individual run has been selected click on the red 'Delete' button that appears at the bottom of the page. On the delete-run page the selected run is displayed as a list along with a yes/no check box to confirm the deletion of the run. Once the user has selected 'yes' they can delete the run from the database by clicking on the red 'Delete' button. If the user clicks on the 'Delete' button without slecting the 'yes' checkbox first the following message is displayed; "To delete Pool_XXX select Yes then click Delete". Once the run has been successfully deleted the following message will be displayed; "Pool_XXX has been successfully deleted".

4. Updating Selected Run - Once an individual run has been selected click on the yellow 'Update' button that appears at the bottom of the page. On the update-run page the selected run data is displayed in the update-run form. The data in each form field can be edited and these changes can be saved to the database by clicking on the yellow 'Update' button beneath the form. Once the run has been successfully updated the following message will be displayed; "Pool_XXX has been successfully updated". If any of the fields are left empty the submission will fail and the message 'Please fill in this field' will appear below the first empty field encountered.

##### Step 5 - Ending User Session
When the user wants to end their session they can click on the blue 'Logout' button located on the right of the header or footer navbar. This directs the user to the logout page which informs the user that they have successfully logged out and provides a link to return to the sites main homepage.

#### Using the Site as a Registered User with Admin Privileges

##### Step 1 - Logging into an Admin Account
On the homepage registered users can access the log-in page by clicking on the blue 'Login' button located on the right of the header or footer navbar. On the log-in page registered users can access their account by entering their unique username into the login form on the login page. If the user has admin privileges they are directed to the admin-or-user page where they can choose to continue as either a regular user or as an admin-user. If the later option is chosen then the user is prompted to provide their email address as further confirmation of their identity. Once successfully logged the admin-user is directed to the admin page where they can choose to manage user run data or manage user accounts.

##### Step 2 - Managing User Run Data as Admin-User
1. Selecting User Runs - On the manage-user-runs page the admin user can either select all the runs for an individual user by using the default filter run settings and then selecting a user from the dropdown menu. Alternatively they can adjust the filter run settings to select the type of runs displayed, then select a user from the dropdown menu. Once the appropriate settings have been made the run data can be displayed by clicking on the blue 'Select' button.

Once 'yes' has been selected the user can be deleted from the database by clicking on the red 'Delete' button. If the 'Delete' button is clicked without selecting the 'yes' checkbox first the following message is displayed; "To delete user account for 'selected user' select Yes then click Delete". Once the user has been successfully deleted the following message will be displayed; "User account for 'selected user' has been successfully deleted".

4. Updating Selected User Account - Once an individual user account has been selected click on the yellow 'Update' button that appears at the bottom of the page. On the update-run page the selected user information is displayed in the update-run form. The data in each form field can be edited and these changes can be saved to the database by clicking on the yellow 'Update' button beneath the form. Once the user information has been successfully updated the following message will be displayed; "User account for 'selected user' has been successfully updated". If any of the fields are left empty the submission will fail and the message 'Please fill in this field' will appear below the first empty field encountered.

##### Step 4 - Ending Admin-User Session
When the admin-user wants to end their session they can click on the blue 'Logout' button located on the right of the header or footer navbar. This directs the admin-user to the logout page which informs the user that they have successfully logged out and provides a link to return to the sites main homepage.


## Main Features

### Main Page

The main page allows all users of the site to view the qc data for all sequencing runs. The page is divided into two sections. The first section has four modal links that display qc data as line charts. The second section contains two modal links that display qc data as pie charts. From the main page the user is able to access the login or signup page.

### Login Page

The login page allows a registered user to log into their user account using their unique username. If successful the user is directed to the main user page.

### Signup Page

The signup page allows unregistered users to create a user account by entering a unique username into the signup form.

### User Page

The user page (accessed by logging in with username) allows the user to view all of the qc data for their own sequencing runs. The page has the main layout features as the main page. From the user page the user is able to access the add-run page and the manage-runs page.

### Add Run Page

The add-run page allows the user to add new qc run data to the database.

### Manage Runs Page

The manage-runs page allows the user to view qc data for individual runs or groups of runs. Once an individual run has been selected, the user is able to access the delete-run or update-run pages.

### Admin or User Page

The admin-or-user page allows users with admin privileges to choose to login as a standard user or as an admin user.

### Admin Page

The admin-page (accessed by verifying email address) allows the user with admin privileges to choose to manager user runs or manage user accounts.

### Manage User Runs Page

The manage-user-runs page allows the admin-user to select all the runs for a selected user or to filter runs for a selected user using various criteria. The user can then select an individual run. Once an individual run has been selected the qc data for that run is displayed and the admin-user is able to access the delete-run or update-run page.

### Delete Run Page

The delete-run page allows the user or admin-user to delete the currently selected run.

### Update Run Page

The update-run page allows the user or admin-user to update the currently selected run.

### Manage Users Page

The manage-users page allows the admin-user to select individual user accounts. Once an individual user has been selected their account details are displayed and the admin-user is able to access the delete-user or update-user page.

### Delete User Page

The delete-user page allows the admin-user to delete the currently selected user account.

### Update User Page

The update-user page allows the admin-user to update the currently selected user account.

### Logout Page

Accessed via the logout button and allows the user or admin-user to end their current session. Informs the user that they have successfully logged out and provides a link back to the main page.

### Permission Denied Page

If the user tries to access a user account, other than the current user count, via the url address then they will be redirected to the permission-denied page. The permission-denied page informs the current user that they don't have permission to go to that page and provides a link back to the main page.

### 404 Error Page

If the user attempts to use a url that does not exist then they will be redirected to the 404 page. The 404 page will inform the current user that the page they are trying to access doesn't exist and provides a link back to the main page.


### Features Left to Implement

- Add password as well as username to access user accounts for increased security

- Add pass fail criteria for sequencing runs based on metric values.

- Add 'Clinical Trial' catergory e.g. CRUK to database and restrict access of standard & admin users accordingly to provide further security.

- Add ability to share or transfer ownership of sequencing runs to other users.

- Add more charts for further analysis of qc metrics e.g. plot cluster density against q30 values.

- Link the website to the Illumina Basespace api to obtain further run data (requires further investigation).

## Testing

### Testing Stories

- During a milestone project review I was informed that my site wasn't secure because it was possible to access another users account by editing the url address. To address this security issue I added a check to each route that compared the url username with current session username. If they didn't match the user would be redirected to the permission denied page.

- At an early point during development, I realised that if an incorrect username was entered into the login form the site provided no feedback. To fix this problem a check was added to compare the username entered into the login form with the list of usernames in the database. If no match was found, the message "Username 'XXX' not found, please try a different username or sign up" was returned to inform the user. Also the site was modified so the signup button is displayed so the current user has the opportunity to sign up with a new user name.

- A similar issue became apparent with the sign up form. It was possible to enter a username that already existed. To fix this problem a check was added to compare the username entered into the signup form with the list of usernames in the database. If a match was found the message "username 'XXX' already exists, enter a unique username or login" was returned to inform the user. Also the site was modified so the login button is displayed so the current user has the opportunity to log in with an existing username. If no match was found the username was added to the database and the message "congratulations 'XXX', your username has been added to the database" was returned.

- The select user dropdown menu on the admin-select-user page was displaying two entries for the user Andrew. I tried various solutions with no success, including the loop.index jinja method to try to force the dropdown menu to automatically select the first list item. Eventually I realised this was an actual error in the database. The user account username for Wayne had been accidendly changed to Andrew. This reminded me that checking the obvious things first can save you a lot of time.

- An internal server error occurred when an existing run number or different username was entered into the form on the add-user-run page. This was being caused by a keyword error for "messageInfo". It was fixed by modifying the nesting of if statements and the addition of more return statements to the addUserRun helper functon.

- At around the mid point during development, I realised I needed tighter control of the numerical metric values being entered into the add-run and update-run forms. This was achieved by creating a 'checkMetricValues' helper function that checked all numberical metric values are within a specified range. If any metric is outside it's specified range an error message is returned. If all values pass then the message 'pass' is returned.

- Whilst testing the admin-delete-user form I realised that when a user was deleted their runs were not being deleted because they are stored in a separate collection. This was fixed by adding the appropriate mongodb query to the adminDeleteUser helper function.

- A similar issue became apparent with the admin-update-user form. I realised that if a user changed their username, then there username also had to change in each of their runs.  This wasn't happening because they are stored in a separate collection. This was fixed by adding the appropriate mongodb query to the adminUpdateUser helper function.

- On the admin-update-user form it was possible to enter a value other than 'user' or 'admin' into the membership input field. This was addressed by changing this field to a dropdown menu with only 'user' and 'admin' as possible options.

- During a mile stone project review it was suggested that my flash messaging should be color coded i.e. green for success, red for error. This was achieved by adding the 'with_categories' to the get_flashed_messages function and setting it to true. This made it possible to link css classnames to flash messages. 

- On larger screens (>1200px) the 'info' button on the index and user page was being forced out of position. This was fixed by applying an additional media query at 1200px or above that changed the positioning of the button from absolute to relative and changed the top and left position values.


## Deployment

In order to deploy this project you must first set up an account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas). Click [here](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/) for instructions on how to set up able Mongo Atlas account.

## How to Deploy Project Using Gitpod

1. Navigate to the github repository located at https://github.com/TAHJones/qc-metrics-analyser.

2. Create a Gitpod workspace using one of the following methods:

- Prefix the github repository URL in the address bar of your browser with https://gitpod.io/# e.g. https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/TAHJones/qc-metrics-analyser

- If you have installed the Gitpod [extension](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension/) for Chrome or Firefox click on the green 'Gitpod' button located on the top right of the github repository homepage.

3. If using Gitpod for the first time, you will have to authorize access to your GitHub account. This is necessary so you can access your data from within Gitpod.

4. Gitpod will create a workspace container for you in the cloud, containing a full Linux system. It will also clone the GitHub repository branch based on the GitHub page you were coming from.

5. Click 'Select Python interpreter' in the blue bar at the bottom of the page then select 'Python 3.7.4 64-bit ('3.7.4': pyenv) from the dropdown menu.

6. Open a terminal and run the following command to install project dependencies:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
6. In the projects root directory create a file called `env.py`.

7. Inside the env.py file create SECRET_KEY, MONGO_DBNAME and MONGO_URI environment variables to link to your own mongodb database. Please make sure to call your database `sequencingMetricsDB`, with 2 collections called `users` and `seqMetCol`. You will find example json structures for these collections in the [schemas](https://github.com/TAHJones/qc-metrics-analyser/tree/master/schemas/) folder.

8. You can now run the application from the terminal using the following command:
```
python3 app.py
```

## How to Deploy Project Using Heroku

1. Create a `requirements.txt` file from the terminal using the command `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`.

2. Create a `Procfile` from the terminal using the command `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`.

3. `git add` and `git commit` the new requirements and Procfile and then `git push` the project to GitHub.

3. Create a new app on the [Heroku website](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) by clicking the "New" button in your dashboard. Give it a name and set the region to Europe.

4. From the heroku dashboard of your new app, click on "Deploy" > "Deployment method" and select GitHub.

5. In the **App connected to GitHub** section confirm the heroku app is linked to the correct GitHub repository.

6. In the heroku dashboard for the application, click on "Settings" > "Reveal Config Vars".

7. Set the following config vars:

| Key | Value |
 --- | ---
DEBUG | FALSE
IP | 0.0.0.0
MONGO_URI | `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster_name>-kpu2s.mongodb.net/<database_name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
PORT | 5000
SECRET_KEY | `<your_secret_key>`

- To get you MONGO_URI read the MongoDB Atlas documentation [here](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/)

8. In the heroku dashboard, click "Deploy".

9. In the **Automatic Deploys** section click **Enable Automatic Deploys** to ensure your heroku app is automatically updated everytime your github repository is updated.

10. Click on the "Open App" button at the top of the page. The [Heroku website]( https://qc-metrics-analyser.herokuapp.com/) is now successfully deployed.
